# InDepth - Development branch
## Gameplay Progression - General Overview
Two modes
* UHS-mode: No healing, hard  difficulty, maybe some harder crafting recipies.
* Normal: Healing, vanilla toggle difficulty, maybe change crafting recipies for each difficulty.

- Start with wooden/stone tools, no iron tools available until you finish the tinkers construct smeltery. However, advanced tinkers construct tools should be unavailable until you progress some other mods. (Maybe add Ex Astris to start without stone, and build your way up from wooden tools)
- Start with basics of most mods (Thaumcraft, Botania, EnderIO ...). Advanced recipies should not be craftable yet, since some resources still miss (They are advanced ofc..). Mods should use items from other mods, this way to progress in a particular mod, you need a certain progression in another mod. For example you need Steel from EnderIO to craft Thaumium ingots (instead of the basic iron)
- Once a certain level is reached in all mods, the advanced tinkers construct tools, and alloys should be available.
- With these new alloys, better ores can be mined which previously couldn't
- Now its possible to progress with other mods, it will probably be possible to obtain tools from other mods by now. They should be good/easy enough to make the player choose between these and other same tier tools from other mods. (for example Tinkers Construct tools and Botania ManaSteel/Terrasteel tools). Preferably they should be equally strong and easy to make, but differ in resources.
- Rinse and repeat, some mods might join later, since they cover mostly advanced gameplay, for example Big Reactors should only be available when a player reached far into endgame.
- Some mods might lose value over time, for example Ex Astris, but players should have used a mod for quite a while.
- Some items might need to be disabled due to OP-ness/unfairness or redunancy
